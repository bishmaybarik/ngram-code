# District Name Matching using N-grams and Jaccard Similarity

This repository contains a Python notebook that automates the process of matching district names between two datasets: `people_of_india_clean_2014.csv` and `minority_conc_census_2011.csv`. The matching is performed using n-grams and Jaccard similarity to compare district names and identify the most similar pairs.
